# Memory Card Game

This project is a web-based Memory Card Game, a classic memory-testing game where players need to match pairs of cards. The game is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to enhance front-end development skills.

## Features

- **Card Matching**: Click on cards to reveal hidden images. Match pairs of cards to keep them face up.
- **Move Counter**: Track the number of moves made by the player.
- **Timer**: Track the time taken to complete the game.
- **New Game Button**: Shuffle the cards and start a new game.
- **Responsive Design**: The game works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- **Congratulations Message**: Display a message when all pairs are successfully matched.
